Swift-Intelligence
==================

This is a project for Machine Learning algorithms with Swift for future iOS development. 
I plan to compile my scripts into a useful library that will help translate many useful Python machine learning algorithms into Swift

Currently, I am looking to focus on Bayes theorem, Neural Networks, and more. My hope is to eventually make something similar to PyBrain, but for Swift.

Feel free to contribute.
