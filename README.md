#Swift Brain
The first neural networking and machine learning library written in Swift. This is a project for AI algorithms in Swift for iOS and OS X development. 

This project includes algorithms focused on Bayes theorem, neural networks, SVMs and Matrices. 

##Roadmap
- [ ] compile scripts into a useful library.
- [ ] autonomously translating Python ML algorithms into Swift.
- [ ] Incorporate elements of NumPy and PyBrain in Swift.
