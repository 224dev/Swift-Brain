Swift-Intelligence
==================

This is a project for Machine Learning algorithms with Swift for future iOS development. 
I plan to compile my scripts into a useful library that will help translate many useful Python machine learning algorithms into Swift

Currently, I am looking to focus on Bayes theorem, Neural Networks, and more. My hope is to eventually make something similar to SciPy and PyBrain combined, but for Swift.

Feel free to contribute.


##Topics being Developed 
####Matrices
    1. Matrix operations
####Machine Learning algorithms 
    2. Neural Networks
    3. Support Vector Machines
    4. Bayesian Classifiers 
    5. Self Organized Maps (maybe?)
####Statistics
    1. Bayes Theorem
    2. Kalman Filter
