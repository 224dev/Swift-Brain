#Swift Brain
The first neural networking and machine learning library written in Swift. This is a project for AI algorithms in Swift for iOS and OS X development. 

This project includes algorithms focused on Bayes theorem, neural networks, SVMs and Matrices. 

##Roadmap
- [x] Matrices (and matrix operations).
- [ ] compile scripts into a useful library.
- [ ] autonomously translating Python ML algorithms into Swift.
- [ ] Incorporate elements of NumPy and PyBrain in Swift.
- [ ] Self organising maps.

###Ongoing Development
- Machine Learning algorithms 
    - Basic regressions
    - Neural networks
    - Support vector machines
    - Bayesian Classifiers 
    - Self organised maps (maybe?)
    - Clustering
- Statistics
    -  Bayes theorem/naive classifier
    -  Kalman filter 
    -  Markov model
