Swift-Brain
==================
The first Neural Network/Machine Learning library for Apple's Swift

This is a project for AI algorithms in Swift for iOS development. 
I plan to compile my scripts into a useful library that will help translate my Python machine learning algorithms into Swift

Currently, I am looking to focus on Bayes theorem, Neural Networks, SVMs, and Matrices. My hope is to eventually incorporate elements of NumPy and PyBrain.

##Topics being Developed 
1. Matrices
    +  Matrix operations
2. Machine Learning algorithms 
    +  Basic Regressions
    +  Neural Networks
    +  Support Vector Machines
    +  Bayesian Classifiers 
    +  Self Organized Maps (maybe?)
    +  Clustering
3. Statistics
    +  Bayes Theorem/Naive Classifier
    +  Kalman Filter 
    +  Markov Model
