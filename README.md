#Swift Brain
The first neural networking and machine learning library written in Swift. This is a project for AI algorithms in Swift for iOS and OS X development. This project includes algorithms focused on Bayes theorem, neural networks, SVMs, Matrices, etc.. Feel free to contribute.

###Ongoing Development
  Tools:
- [x] Matrix operations
 Machine Learning algorithms
- [ ] Basic regressions
- [x] Kalman filter 
- [x] Neural networks
- [ ] Support vector machines
- [ ] Bayesian Classifiers 
- [ ] Clustering
- [ ] Self Organizing
 Statistics
- [ ]  Bayes theorem/naive classifier
- [ ]  Markov model

###Installation and Setup
Carthage is a decentralised dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Swift-Brain into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "vlall/Swift-Brain" "master"
```
