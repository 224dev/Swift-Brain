Swift-Intelligence
==================

This is a project for Machine Learning algorithms with Swift for future iOS development. 
I plan to compile my scripts into a useful library that will help translate many useful Python machine learning algorithms into Swift

Currently, I am looking to focus on Bayes theorem, Neural Networks, and more. My hope is to eventually make something similar to SciPy and PyBrain combined, but for Swift.

Feel free to contribute.


##Topics being Developed 
1. Matrices
    a. Matrix operations
2. Machine Learning algorithms 
    a. Neural Networks
    b. Support Vector Machines
    c. Bayesian Classifiers 
    d. Self Organized Maps (maybe?)
3. Statistics
    a. Bayes Theorem
    b. Kalman Filter
