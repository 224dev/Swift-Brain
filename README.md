Swift-Brain
==================
*The first ever Neural Network/Machine Learning library for Apple's Swift...*

This is a project for AI algorithms in Swift for iOS development. 
I plan to compile my scripts into a useful library that will help translate my Python machine learning algorithms into Swift

Currently, I am looking to focus on Bayes theorem, Neural Networks, SVMS, and Matrices. My hope is to eventually make something similar to NumPy + SciPy + PyBrain combined, but for Swift.

Feel free to contribute.

##Topics being Developed 
1. Matrices
    + Matrix operations
2. Machine Learning algorithms 
    +  Neural Networks
    +  Support Vector Machines
    +  Bayesian Classifiers 
    +  Self Organized Maps (maybe?)
3. Statistics
    +  Bayes Theorem
    +  Kalman Filter
